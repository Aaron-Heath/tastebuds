# TasteBuds
## Description
Cooking is a universal aspect of life, one of the few things shared no matter who or where you are. TasteBuds creates a way for that to be shared and enjoyed with family, friends, and acquaintances. It provides a singular place to find all your saved recipes without having to hunt through old messages or try to get back to something you saw online, and it does it all without you having to read someoneâ€™s life story before getting to the real cooking!  The live deployment can be found [here](https://tastebuds-app-de96bd264a71.herokuapp.com/).

TasteBuds is focused on sharing and collaboration. Share your cookbooks with friends so they can add their own recipes alongside yours. Keep your cookbook private to those you share it with, or allow everyone to view your fantastic recipes. Control rests in the user's hand to decide how much or how little they want to share with the community.


## Usage

Upon registration, users will be directed to the homepage. They are provided a default <strong>My Cookbook</strong> as a private directory to store their cookbooks. From there, users can choose their own journey! You have the option to:
* Add recipes to your existing cookbook
* Create a new cookbook
* Share your cookbooks with friends
* Explore existing public cookbooks
